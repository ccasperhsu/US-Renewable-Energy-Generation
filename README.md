This interactive dashboard is viewable on Tableau Public: [US Electricity Generation Mix 1990 - 2024](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casper.hsu/viz/copy_17638335912670/Dashboard2#1)

## Introduction

  In the project [US Electric Grid Outages](https://github.com/ccasperhsu/US-Electric-Grid-Outages), the data shows that worsening climate change combined with aging energy infrastructure has led to increasingly severe power outages in recent years. Because carbon reduction is widely viewed as a key strategy for mitigating global warming, many nations have prioritized electrifying appliances and replacing traditional power generation with carbon-free sources, particularly renewables.

  With the production of electric vehicles and data centers on the rise, it is becoming more important to examine how well the existing generation is set up to meet the demand while keeping emissions in check. This dashboard examines how the United States has progressed in generating its electricity using renewable energy sources. The insights gained can help inform policy development, guide business planning, and influence household decision-making, among other applications.


## Data

  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) published the data used in this dashboard that includes net generation by State, by type of producer, and by energy Source from 1990 to 2024. EIA also publishes a high level aggregation for each of the primary source from 1950 to 2023 in its [Generation By Major Source Data](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/charts/generation-major-source.csv) that can be quickly cross referenced. The Excel file in this repository was downloaded from EIA's [Historical State Data](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ 
) site, under *EIA-923 Power Plant Operations Report*. The Tableau dashboard used a subset of the dataset that excluded producer details. The following table is a list of all generation sources, and the sources counted towards “renewables” are highlighted in green.

## Key Takeaways
- Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of total electricity generated from renewables in the US grew almost 10% from 10.36% to 19.53%. 
- Texas overtook California in the year 2020 as the largest producer for electricity generated from renewable sources, though California’s generation mix contains 20% more green energy relatively in 2024. 
- Solar (thermal and PV panels) and wind generation have exhibited the quickest growth in recent years, with wind generation outpacing conventional hydroelectric in 2019.
- Vermont produced almost 100% of its electricity from renewables in 2024.

This progress reflects broader policy choices at the federal level. While past administrations set ambitious clean-energy and emissions-reduction targets, the long-term transition will depend on consistent support for renewables — especially as electricity demand rises sharply.
