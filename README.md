# US Renewable Energy Generation Mix 1990 - 2024

  In the project examing major electricity outages, (link to outage project) the data showed that a combination of worsening climate change and aging energy infrastructure has led to more severe outages in recent years. Carbon reduction is often considered the primary remedy to combat global warming, thus electrifying appliances and replacing electricity generation sources with carbon free sources, which often includes renewables, has become a priority for many nations across the globe. 

  With the production of electric vehicles and data centers on the rise, it is more crucial to examine how well the existing generation is set up to meet the demand. This dashboard examines how the United States has progressed in generating its electricity using renewable energy sources. The insights derived from these dashboards can be used to guide policy formation, business expansion, household spending, just to name a few. 

## Data:

  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes historical data that dates back to 1990 and up to 2024. The original data, EIA-923 Power Plant Operations Report, includes net generation by State by type of producer by energy Source. The Excel file can be downloaded from EIA's [Historical State Data](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ 
) site. The Tableau dashboard used a subset of the dataset that excluded producer details. The following table is a list of all generation sources, and the sources counted towards “renewables” are highlighted in green.

## Key Insights:
- Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of total electricity generated from renewables in the US grew almost 10% from 10.23% to 19.39%. 
- Texas overtook California in the year 2020 as the largest producer for electricity generated from renewable sources.
- While Texas has the highest green electricity generated, California’s generation mix contains 20% more green energy relative to Texas in 2024. 
- Solar (thermal and PV panels) and wind generation have exhibited the quickest growth in recent years, with wind generation outpacing conventional hydroelectric in 2019.
- Vermont produced almost 100% of its electricity from renewables in 2024.

The progress made towards combating climate change is intimately tied to the policies set on the federal level. While the Biden administration constructed ambitious goals, such as reaching net zero emissions by 2050, tripling clean energy infrastructure investment, and scaling up international climate finance, the current administration has aggressively repealed related efforts, with the most notable action being the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. According to Climate Action Tracker(https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/), a non-profit organization that measures how closely nations are following the Paris Agreement, “States are and will continue to advance the Biden Administration’s progress on climate action. The 2035 NDC (Nationally Developed Contribution) target, submitted by the Biden Administration in 2024, was developed in close consultation with state governments and can still guide state action on mitigating emissions. The US Climate Alliance — a bipartisan coalition of 24 states and territories—remains committed to advancing climate action.”
